# Wine Tasting Data Analysis

Welcome to the Wine Tasting Data Analysis repository! This project focuses on the analysis of wine tasting data, exploring insights and trends within the dataset. The analysis has been conducted using Jupyter Notebook, and the main solution file is named `Solution.ipynb`.

## Getting Started

To get started with the analysis, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TUR14CUS/wine-tasting-data-analysis.git
   cd wine-tasting-analysis
   ```

2. **Download the Dataset:**
   The dataset is stored in a compressed CSV file named `wines.csv.zip`. Please unzip this file to access the raw data for analysis.

3. **Open the Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Solution.ipynb
   ```
   This will open the Jupyter Notebook in your default web browser. Navigate to the `Solution.ipynb` file to explore the analysis.

## Contents

- **Solution.ipynb:**
  The Jupyter Notebook containing the data analysis process, visualizations, and insights derived from the wine tasting dataset.

- **wines.csv.zip:**
  The compressed CSV file containing the wine tasting dataset. Unzip this file before running the Jupyter Notebook.

## Data Analysis

The analysis covers various aspects of the wine tasting dataset, including but not limited to:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Descriptive statistics
- Data visualizations (plots, graphs)
- Key insights and trends

Feel free to explore the Jupyter Notebook to understand the methodology, code, and findings of the analysis.

## Dependencies

The analysis is implemented using common Python libraries for data analysis and visualization. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
```
